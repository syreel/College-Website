					<p class=MsoTitle align=center style='text-align:center'>Website Tools - Unit 28 M2 and Unit 28 D2</p>

					<h1>Notepad ++</h1>

					<p class=MsoNormal>For some of the web development I used a program called
					notepad ++ because it can highlight the syntax that you are using and allows
					you to read the code much easier. Another benefit of notepad ++ is that it
					doesn’t add any formatting unlike Microsoft word which puts formatting points
					at the end of lines for example which can break the code and prevent the
					website from working properly.</p>

					<h1><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri;mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-latin'>Sublime
					Text<o:p></o:p></span></h1>

					<p class=MsoNormal>For the bulk of the programming for the website I used a
					program called sublime. This is because it also does the syntax highlighting
					which allows you to read the code much easier especially when the website is
					long. Another reason why I used sublime is because it can auto-complete small
					pieces of the code as you are typing it which allows you to focus less on
					closing individual tags and allows you to focus on the content and making the
					website look and function better.</p>

					<h1>Chrome Developer Tools</h1>

					<p class=MsoNormal>During the development of my site i used the chrome browser
					to view my webpage. I used chrome because it is one of the most up to date
					browsers and supports a high percentage of the css and html specification.
					Within the chrome browser I used the developer menu to change the CSS on the
					fly to make sure that the changes I were making definitely did what I wanted
					them to do. This is also good because it means that if something that I change
					breaks the page then I can just refresh the page to try again from the saved
					files. Using this technique it is also much faster to develop the css for the
					site because you can see the result of the changes that you are making live on
					the screen and do not have to wait for the file to save and the page to refresh
					before you can see the result and make changes accordingly.</p>

					<h1>GitHub</h1>

					<p class=MsoNormal>I used GitHub during the development of the website for this
					project because it allows me to make a save copy of my work in increments as I
					change parts of the page. This therefore means that if I accidentally delete a
					file that was actually important and that I need to get back I can just restore
					my save to an older copy from GitHub. This also means that if a change that I
					make breaks the website and I cannot work out how to fix it then I can revert
					my repository to an older version and try again from the latest commit.</p>

					<h1>Stencyl</h1>

					<p class=MsoNormal>In order to develop the game in this website I used a
					software package called Stencyl. This software is used to develop simple games
					very quickly and easily. This package was good for making my game because my
					game is simple and doesn’t need any complicated 3d game engines and therefore
					Stencyl is the best package for doing this in the shortest package. Stencyl is
					free for small flash games and therefore it is ideal for learning to program
					and make games. </p>

					<h1>Word</h1>

					<p class=MsoNormal>In order to type up all the documentation for this project I
					used word because it is simple and easy to use for typing up lots of
					documentation and formatting it to make it visually appealing.</p>

					<h1>Photoshop</h1>

					<p class=MsoNormal>In order to make the graphics for the game and the logo for
					the website I used the adobe Photoshop software because it allows me to make
					high detail images relatively quickly.</p>

					<div style='mso-element:para-border-div;border:none;border-bottom:solid #4F81BD 1.0pt;
					mso-border-bottom-themecolor:accent1;padding:0cm 0cm 4.0pt 0cm'>

					<p class=MsoTitle align=center style='text-align:center'>Techniques</p>

					</div>

					<h1>HTML</h1>

					<p class=MsoNormal>To develop the main frame for the website I used the html
					programming language this is because this language is simple and allows you to
					make a basic template of how the website will be structured and allows you to
					change the content of the website without having to reformat the whole page.</p>

					<h1>CSS</h1>

					<p class=MsoNormal>To change how the website looks and to make it look better I
					used the CSS language because it integrates with the html frame very well and
					allow you to change how the framework of the html page looks when displayed in
					a supported browser. CSS is simple to learn and allows you to quickly edit how
					the site looks. Using the chrome developer menu I was able to live edit the CSS
					of the page and see the result in real time speeding up the development
					process.</p>

					<h1>JavaScript</h1>

					<p class=MsoNormal>To make the menu system on the website I used JavaScript this
					is because in order to make the website interactive you need to use JavaScript
					because this has the ability to change how the webpage looks while the page is
					still loaded on the user’s browser. Because the page can be edited live it is
					possible for the webpage to completely change without refreshing the page
					therefore you can have a menu that only shows up when you hover over it.
					Dropdown menus are only possible because of JavaScript. </p>

					<h1>JQuery</h1>

					<p class=MsoNormal>JQuery is a library for JavaScript that simplifies and
					streamlines the process of programming in JavaScript. It is very useful for
					making menus because it allows you to use selectors which are very useful for
					deciding what parts of the page you want to change much easier than with raw
					JavaScript.</p>

					<h1>Stencyl Events</h1>

					<p class=MsoNormal>In Stencyl I used the events system in order to decide what
					I wanted the actors to do and what they should react to. These events are very
					versatile and allow you to program your actors very quickly and allows for
					rapid prototyping if required</p>
					
					<h1>techniques that could be used to aid user access to information </h1>
					To make the website more user friendly it would be a good idea to make sure the layout of the webpage is simple because otherwise it could confuse people whp are wanting to try and use the page and could cause people to leave. If the colour scheme of the website does not match or look very good then it could be a distraction for the people trying to use the site because there is too much going on the screen and they cannot work out where they are supposed to be loking. having a clear layout and good colour scheme will allow people to see easily what they are after on the page aswell as not be confused by too man things going on in the page because alot of things going on in the page such as videos playing adverts on the side and a lot of text can be very distracting for people.
					Another way to make the site more interesting and easy to use would eb to include the use of sound because if you click on a link then it would help to reassue the user by making a clicking sound as they will know for definate that the button has been clicked. Using an animation on the page for the logo could help keep users interested in the page.
					to improve the useability of the page the website could have more imfornation availiable to the user however they could be put behind some security such as htaccess because this would mean that people without the login visitin the page will still have functionally of the webpage however it could mean that other people who have the login could use extra functionality on the page such as changing the page as a website administrator or accessing your sotred infromation on the site.
					
					
					
					<h2>Javascript menus and buttons</h2>
					by using interactive featues in the website such as a menu system that drops down on the page to allow for more precise navigation of the website. using this method will allow the webpage to be much simpler to navigate and therefore easier to use. Another benefit of using these drop down types of menu is that they allow for the main site to look much cleaner becauseyou do not have links all over the page because instead you have a menu that only appears when it is needed.
					Another way of using this type of menu system is that for people viewing on a mobile device they can use a different stylesheet and menu system to allow them to be able to see the menu because the menu will be able to dynamically change how it looks and how it works compleately based on the screen size of the users device. For example on a desktop the menu system could be on the top but on a mobile device the menu could pop out fromt he side when an icon is pressed because then the menu doesnt have to take u valuable screen realestate.
					javascript buttons can be used to let the user know when they are hovering on a button for example by changing their colour slightly and then changing again as the button is pressed which will allow the user to receive feedback based on their actions and make their user experiecne more seamless and enjoyable.
					<br /><br />
					
					<h2>Disabilities</h2>
					<h3>Colourblindness</h3> In order to account for people with colourblindness the website could have a system where you can customise the colour scheme used on the website so that if you are viewing the site and you are havin difficulty reading the text on the page then you can go to the page settings and change the colour of the text on the page. this information can then be saved in the browser to make sure that every time that user visits your site they are able to see correctly.
					<h3>Poor Eyesight</h3> in order to compensate for people with bad eye sight the website could use the same system as mentioned above in order to change the size of the text on the screen, for example if somebody has trouble seing the display up close then you could change the size of the text on the page to allow them to see it better.
					
					<h2>Customisation</h2> In order to customise the website you could have the same colour changing system as used for people with coulourblindness however instead of making the colour options have more colour seperation to make them easier to read you can give them total control of what your websites colours looks like so the user can choose their experience on your site.
