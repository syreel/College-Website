					<p class=MsoNormal>A study was done on the use of active video games such as
dance games and others. This study included testing of using these types of
games in pe class in schools vs traditional school pe class methods.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The typical view of gaming is that children who game are
quite obese and get no exercise but<span style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:
115%;font-family:"Verdana","sans-serif";color:#111111;background:white'> t</span>his
quote sums up this quite well:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“But if a kid hates playing dodge ball but loves Dance Dance
Revolution why not let him work up a sweat playing E-games?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It states that not all children or teenagers are into the
outdoor activities or other sporty activities therefore they won’t actually do
much exercise at all. Through the use of active video games it gives the
children something to do e.g. play the game instead of just “pointlessly” run
around therefore it may make children more likely to do some physical
activities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Not all children are the same and what children have an
interest in or like to do in their free time changes from child to child
therefore if we want children to get more active we really need to start
appealing to all the children rather than just the ones that are into the
physical activities and other sporty stuff.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Playing an active game makes the ‘chore’ of exercise not so
bad because you have something to focus your thoughts on and therefore after
playing for a while you may actually start to forget that you are getting exercise
while playing these type of games therefore even if it is the only form of
activities that you do then it is still better than nothing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Using this method we can use video games to do the exact
opposite of making children obese because children may do more exercise than
they may do otherwise.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another benefit for the positive effects on the body from
games is that video games can (as shown in a study) actually improve your
eyesight in certain cases.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This mostly applies to people either with caterax and
similar. The study showed that for some people with caterax they could improve
their vision through playing fps games including call of duty. Playing fast
paced games such as these forces the player to focus on what they are doing and
they require a lot of attention. Playing these fast paced games can make your
body product more dopamine this makes the player happier and this will continue
after the gameplay ends.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Studies show that playing games can lead to better hand eye
coordination and tracking. For example people who play FPS games have shown to
be able to track things better due to the intense concentration required in
order to play game. There have been studies that show that even adults can gain
an effect from playing action computer games for example fighter pilots and
surgeons can gain an advantage from playing computer games and they can gain
better fine motor skills. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<h2><span style='background:white'>Story 4:<o:p></o:p></span></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Research shows that there is a new type of game coming up
which does what advertising fatty foods on TV does and they are called
advergames. These games have advertisements in which can include advertisements
for fatty foods and therefore could cause children to do what children do best
and they will nag their parents for what they want which will now be foods
which will be bad for them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Because kids will be eating these fatty foods the matter is
not helped by the fact that they are also playing games instead of playing
outside or doing more active games therefore they will not be burning off all
the fat that they are taking in by eating these foods.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The researchers were “astounded by how often logos or actual
food products were integrated into the game.” This shows that in these games it
is very easy to get guided by the game into buying anything they want you to
buy.</p>

<h2>Story 5:</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>Research shows that
people who play a lot of video games tend to have a lower performance in
schools, a study showed that students that were heavily addicted to games at
home tended to argue with the teachers and fight with their friends. Because of
this behaviour at school it will make the student less able to learn in school
and therefore they will end up with lower grades.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>In this study many
students that were asked told the researchers that their gaming habits were
often responsible for their low grades. Although some studies have shown that
video games can help students concentration this is usually in the short term
and their long term concentration is negatively impacted because of this.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h2>Story 6:</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Studies show that people who play a lot of video games such
as survival games or adventure games where resources are limited and scarce
makes the player better at managing this in real life.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In survival games you need to preserve your
food and water for example as well as any other resources you may need to keep
in order surviving. The management of these recourses in these games gives you
the practice in holding yourself back and saving things therefore when you go
into the real world you will be more likely to save money and other resources
therefore you may find dealing with money easier. This also applies to games in
which you are roll playing for example where you may be doing a job and getting
money then you will need to save up that money and handle it well so that you
can buy the things that you want to buy in the game. These types of games give
you good practice for real life where you will need to be earning money and
saving money to buy things that you want.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Link: <a

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<h2>Story 7:</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Many people who play games on a regular basis make a lot
more connections within their brain which is mostly a good thing and gives a
positive impact on the gamer’s mental performance. Research showed that people
who play lots of fast paced video games cause “certain brain networks that
process vision or hearing are more likely to have enhanced connectivity to the
so-called salience network.” Therefore their mental abilities are heightened.
These increases in the links in the brains will likely increase the person’s
ability to perceive visual stimulus as well as focus attention to a specific
place more robustly. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These changes in the real world can enable the person to
think more effectively as well as take in more information from their
environment. This will be useful because for example when a person is driving
it could improve their ability to perceive potential issues on the road and
therefore increase their road safety.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Many puzzle games may also cause this kind of change which
could lead to the person being able to do puzzles in real life such as at work
it could allow the person to <span class=SpellE>soceed</span> in the workplace
more because they will be better able to deal with challenges posed by their
job or their boss. Being able to work more effectively will be a massive
advantage in life because they will understand potential issues in their work
and get around them or solve them more efficiently than they could otherwise </p>

<h1>Story 8:</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>Decrease in self control</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Studies have shown that highly violent video games can lead
to a decrease in self-control for the players of these games. These changes are
important because in everyday life you are required to exercise self-control
and if you have a psychological inability to do so then you may have problems
in your future life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For example when you are trying to get a job if you have no self-control
then you will be unlikely to get the job because you need to be able to deal
with the situations that occur in the workplace.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The study found that children who were able to hold out on
temptation and wait longer for the gratification and when they were checked up
on a few years after the experiment they were “<span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";
color:black'>more popular with friends and family and more successful in
universities and jobs.”</span></p>
