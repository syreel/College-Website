					<h3>Game Genres</h3>

					<h4>Action</h4>
					Action games generally take a lot of dexterity in either your thumbs for console or in your hands for PC's this is because action games consist of the player shooting or melee attacking there enemies which requires good reflexes and good mental concentration. most action games show the player on the screen in a third person mode. The first types of games created are generally considered as action games. The action game genre consist of different types of sub genre such as platformers where typically the view that the user sees is a side of view in 2d where the user controls a character centered on the screen and the player must navigate tiles and blocks on the screen and sometimes defeat enemies in order to get to an end goal. An example of this is mario which is a game where you must navigate the level avoiding or killing enemies as you go. super mario is an action game because it involves enemies that you wither have to avoid or kill which requires skill and timing <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/50/NES_Super_Mario_Bros.png" style="display: inherit;" alt="Super Mario Bros" />  Another type of action games are shooter games such as call of duty where you have a 3d view of the world and you must use reflexes in order to eliminate enemies that are shooting upon you this type of game is very popular especially on consoles because this type of game is something that you can play casually. Call of duty is a very popular game because of how casual it is for example in cod you can die many times without losing therefore dying isn’t the end of the world this makes the game more enjoyable to less serious gamers where a single life system would get boring or annoying. <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Vp3tDlZY0Q8/maxresdefault.jpg" style="height: 200px; width: 250px; display: inherit;" alt="Call Of Duty" /> <br /> <br />

					<h4>Action Adventure</h4>
					Adventure games are based on the premise that the player wants to adventure and explore his surroundings in order to complete/play the game. Adventure games do not rely on the player doing and reflex actions such as shooting enemies adventure games often require the player to complete puzzles and to make the game entertaining they usually put time pressure on the player to finish puzzles or certain areas. a subtype of action adventure is the text adventure game. Text adventure games are based on the player receiving information via text output usually to a console and the player can input commands and information via the keyboard into the console. a good example of this is zork which is an online text adventure game. <img src="http://www.mrbillsadventureland.com/reviews/x-y-z/zorkR/zork1.jpg" style="height: 200px; width: 230px; display: inherit;" alt="Zork" />
					Graphic Adventure is another subtype of action adventure these types of games are based on the fact that the game usually outputs the information to the user in a combination of text and ascii art such as a drawing of a house, the user will then tell the game what they want to do such an example of this is the game mystery house which was designed for the apple 2 computer. This type of game is sometimes considered better than ordinary text adventures because it allows the user to easily and quickly visualize what the area they are in looks like while still keeping to the text adventure system.

					<h4>RPG (Role Playing Game)</h4>
					RPGs are based on playing the game as a role for example if you are in a game set in a small village then your role in the game might be the mayor for example then when you play the game you are supposed to act like the mayor of the town. Action RPGs are a sub genre of this where you are playing a role however the game is heavily based around the combat element. RPG games are good for people who enjoy story lines because in RPG games the developers are able to lay out a story on rails while still giving the player at least some choice. the combat element of the sandbox
					<img src="http://forum.unity3d.com/attachments/en5oj-jpg.93540/" style="height: 200px; width: 230px; display: inherit;" alt="RPG Game" /> RPGs are another subtype of genre of the RPG genre this type of game is similar in principal to other types of RPG in that your supposed to fulfill your role in the game however these type of RPGs allow you to explore a open world like world for example if you don’t want to complete the missions given to you then you can go of on your own in the world and find side quests that you can do. an example of sandbox RPGs is dragon quest.

					<h4>Simulation</h4>
					simulation type games are designed to simulate either real life or whatever they are based on to the best of their ability for example in a flight simulator the game is designed to be as realistic to earth as possible for example it will hae realistic physics and air resistance therefore when you are playing the game you can fly the plane or aircraft as realistically as possible because the ingame world willbe quite similar to how it would be in real life however these games cannot be perfect and there will be flaws in there system. <img src="http://www.mplsimulatorsolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/23_Boeing737_800_flightsimulator_33.jpg" style="height: 200px; width: 230px; display: inherit;" alt="Flight Simulator" />
					a subtype of this game could be construction and managment simulation this type of game is designed to allow the user to design a town or city for example to how the player wants it to work/look for example if a player is building a town then the simulator must allow them to design it there won way otherwise the game will get very boring quite quickly because the game will be on rails and wont actualy have very much for the user to do.

					<h4>Strategy</h4>
					Strategy games are based on the premise that the player must make descisions on how they want to play the game which will then determine what outcome the game will have for example if the users strategy is very bad then they will likely lose. RTS games or real time strategy games are based on the system of gathering resources and defending yourself and attacking others such as starcraft.
					<img src="http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/starcraft/images/c/cb/Screenshot_SC2_DevGame1.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20080511221659" style="height: 200px; width: 230px; display: inherit;" alt="Starcraft" />
					another subtype of stratgy could be turn-based strategy this is where the player must work out there strategy to compleate a goal and execute it turn by turn while other ai or other people do the same to the same end but on opposing sides a good example of this could be civ 5 where the player must upgrade there forced in order to take over the world however in this game there are lots of different ways to win the game therefore the player must decicde which endgame they are looking at as part of there strategy.
					<img src="http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/civilization/images/b/b0/ZeroOne_game_London_going_down_(Civ5).jpg/revision/latest?cb=20110110224331" style="height: 200px; width: 230px; display: inherit;" alt="Civ 5" />

					<h4>Sports</h4>
					This type of game is based on real life sports or fantasy sports. a subtype of this is racing this type of game is based on the system where the player must drive there car or other vehicle in a race in order to beat the other players/ai a good example of this type of game could be forza 4.
					<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/bc/Forza4_gameplay.png" style="height: 200px; width: 230px; display: inherit;" alt="Forza 4" />
					Another subgenre of this could be sports games these types of games are based on real life sports but they are portraid within a computer game, these type of games are good for partys or gatherings because usually there can be mutliple players of the game at the same time. a good example of this could be wii sports this is a good example because it allows up to 4 people to play at the same time against each other and with each other.

					<h3>Platforms</h3>
					<h4>Mobile</h4>
					Mobile phones and tablets are becoming more and more powerfull and therefore are able to run games however while mobile phones and tablets have the availiable power to enable them to run FPS style games this is not a good idea mainly from the point of view of the screen size on most mobile phones, when playing fps games you need to be able to move your player around, move the camera around, shoot and sometimes more but the look around control and the movement control take up alot of the screen therefore your fingers block most of the screen and it makes the game very hard to play, for mobile phones and tablets it is more effective for games such as platformers and puzzle games a good example is mario or candy crush as the small screen but portability makes it ideal for these time passers.
					<img src="http://www.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/2013520/rs_560x415-130620152330-1024.CandyCrush3.mh.062013.jpg" style="height: 200px; width: 230px; display: inherit;" alt="Candy Crush" />

					<h4>Portable</h4>
					Portable consoles such as the ps vita or Nintendo 3DS can be used for FPS games because they have a built-in joypad and controlls therefore the screen realestate isnt taken up by your fingers however these machines often do not have very powerful hardware in them therefore they are unable to run high end games so the graphics must be dulled down. these games are suited to low level sports games such as fifa or nintendo games such as mario or other platformers.
					<img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ue9AW-IlkGY/maxresdefault.jpg" style="height: 200px; width: 230px; display: inherit;" alt="Fifa on PsVita" />

					<h4>Console</h4>
					Consoles are suited to most types of games such as fps games this is because they have relitively powerful hardware inside them this allows them to run games with decent graphics. most consoles are used in order to play fps games such as cod because controllers are acceptable for playing this type of game however consoles are not usable for games such as csgo or other fast paced games of a similar nature this is because controllers do not have enough accuracy to play these games at a competative level.

					<h4>desktop</h4>
					Desktops have alot of hardware in them and while the power of the hardware varies between systems the upper level of this is so much higher than consoles it allows games of a different class to be run at extreamely high resolution up to 4k with current monitors at a high fps usually 60 although some monitors now allow 140fps which is extreame for gaming but allows extreame precision within games such as in csgo where it matters. desktops are able to play online games aswell such as mmos like runscape as a desktop or laptop are the only things that are capable of this.

					<h3>Technology</h3>
					<h4>AI</h4>
					Ai is a technology that allows the charicters other than the player in game to act in a certian way. For example in most games the passive charicter ai is pretty plain as they just wander aimlessly around the map and allow the player to interact with them. however in most games the at for charicters that are involved in combat is vastly more complex, for example when the charicter sees the player in the game the ai of the charicter may make then hide and try and get away from the player in a situation where the ai knows that it cannot kill the player while when the ai knows that it is possible to kill the player ie it has high health and a good weapon and the player is weak then the ai could force the charicter to attack the player or use specific tactics such as ducking when the player aims there barrel at the charicter as this would improve the ai's odds. in the game doom 2016 the enemy ai is quite advanced when compared to other ai's in current games therefore this makes the players game harder when they are trying to kill the enemies because the ai is capable of detecting whn the player is aiming at them and jumping out of the way to dodge an incomming shot.

					<h4>Graphics</h4>
					Graphics are incredibly important in gameplay because when a player is playing a game they want to be immersed depensing on what type of game they are playing. For example if the player is playing a FPS game then they want to be immersed in the gameplay with realistic physics and high resolution graphics with higher wuality textures making the world look more realistic in the game. Graphics are incredibly important in oculus rift or other vr headsets because the game world is all the player can see which means that bad graphics will prevent the user from being fully immersed within the game. however in platformers such as mario the graphics arent as important as in FPS games but they are still required. low resolution graphics are actually a graphics style for platformers called 16bit or 8bit etc.. graphics.
					<img src="http://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/oculus_rift_UE4.jpg"  style="height: 200px; width: 230px; display: inherit;" alt="Oculus Rift" />

					<h4>Audio</h4>
					In games audio is extreamely important no matter what style of game you are playing for example if you are playing an fps game such as call of duty or counter strike and these games had no sound the game would be extreamely boring because it would be like nothing is happening, sounds in games help to immerse the player within the game world because from real life we know that doing certain things makes a certain sound and if the game does not replicate this effective enough then the brain will know that something is wrong and break the immersion compleately. While sounds in platformers such as mario arent as important because there is no immersion but the player needs sounds because games are boring with no sound.
					in FPS games a sense of dirctional sound is quite helpfull, for example if you are in combat and you are being attacked then you need to know whithin a split second what direction they are attacking from and direction sound such as a 7.1 surround sound setup can be extreamely helpfull.
