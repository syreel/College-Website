					<h3>User side performance factors</h3>

					<h5>PC Performance</h5> PC performance is very important with webpages this is because some 

					parts of webpages such as complicated JavaScript scripts are quite resource intensive and if 

					the user does not have a decent performance pc then they will not be able to view the page 

					because the page will go unresponsive after a short time due to a high JavaScript use.

					<h5>Processor</h5> <br /> The processor is very important for webpages as most of the rendering of the 

					html is done using the processor therefore if you have a slow processor then it will take a 

					long time to load webpages and any changes to the page will take a long time.

					Memory – Memory or RAM (random access memory) is relatively important for webpages 

					because when a webpage is loaded onto the screen any recourses that are required for the 

					webpage such as the html JavaScript php and any images and css that may be used by the 

					webpage are stored in your computer’s memory so that the browser can quickly access 

					these resources. If you have slow or little memory, then pages might take longer to load and 

					the web might become unusable.

					<h5>Browser</h5> <br /> The performance of the browser is important for the performance of web pages 

					because when a webpage is loaded it is the browsers job to turn that into a proper user 

					viewable page and if the browser is slow and inefficient it doesn’t matter how good your 

					computer is if you have a slow browser then websites will be slow to load.

					ISP Connection Speed – The internet speed you get from your isp is important because 

					when you request a webpage the information needed to display the webpage must be 

					downloaded to your computer and if you have a slow connection speed then you will not be 

					able to load the information fast enough therefore visiting webpages will take a long time 

					because information will take a long time to arrive at your computer.

					<h3>Server Side Performance Factors</h3> <br />

					<h5>Bandwidth</h5> <br /> The server’s bandwidth is very important in the performance of the 

					webserver. This is because when a user attempts to access the webpage the information 

					that the use will need is transferred over the internet and if the website is quite complicated 

					then there will likely be quite a lot of information that needs to be transferred therefore if 

					there are multiple users attempting to access the website then the bandwidth of the server 

					can get full relatively quickly this will lower the performance of the webpage loading for 

					everybody trying to access it.

					<h5>Number of hits to a page</h5> <br /> The number of hits to a page is important because if the 

					website is getting a lot of traffic then it will start to put more strain on the web server 

					therefore the webpage will start to slow down for everybody that is trying to access the 

					website this could be fixed by hosting the website on multiple web servers in a cluster this 

					would mean half the traffic goes to one server and half to the other cutting down the load 

					File types used on a page – There are multiple different file formats for images, audio 

					and video for use on websites however each has an advantage and a disadvantage:

					JPG – A jpeg is a file format that is commonly used for images it is used very commonly on 

					the internet because it is a compressed file format therefore when a file is transferred as a 

					JPG file it is a smaller file size however because it is lossy compression it means that when 

					an image is converted into jpg format it loses some of its quality and depending on the 

					amount of compression required.

					GIF – A GIF is an image file format that is used to hold multiple images in one file these 

					images can then be played back as a set speed and is commonly used to make short 

					repeating animations. Gifs are used widely on the internet as it is a very common animation 

					BMP – A BMP file is an image file that does not compress images therefore they retain 

					almost all their detail when in this file format however these files are very large for high 

					quality images and therefore are slow to transfer due to this they are not very commonly 

					used on webpages unless a high quality image is required.

					MP3 – An MP3 file is an audio file format that is used to transfer audio files. Mp3 in 

					particular is commonly used because it allows for the compression of the audio when 

					converting it into mp3 files therefore you can save a significant amount of audio in a small 

					file size however you do lose some of the audio quality when you do this.

					AVI – AVI files are audio and video that are played back at the same time. This is used to 

					make a video that has sound synchronized with it this is a very common file format for 

					SWF – The SWF file format is commonly used for more complicated animations these files 

					can store more frames than a gif file can therefore they are used for more professional 

					animations. These can be used on the internet but the file sizes are quite large.

					Executions to be carried out before website performs – The amount of executions 

					to be performed before the website performs is important because if there is a lot of 

					executions to carry out when the user clicks on a menu item for example then the response 

					form the web server allowing them to go to the requested location will be delayed because 

					the website will have to perform a lot of actions and each of these takes time.

					<h3>Security</h3> <br />

					<h5>Hackers</h5> <br /> Hackers are a big problem on the internet because there are lots of hackers on 

					the internet. Hackers will access your computer via security holes these can be found in 

					many places such as people not having a firewall installed on your computer this could 

					potentially mean that a hacker can gain access to your computer with little effort.

					Viruses – Viruses are malicious pieces of software often written by criminals these piece of 

					software often hide in other pieces of legitimate software in order to infiltrate a user’s 

					computer. These viruses can be programmed to do almost anything from sending your 

					passwords to the criminal in question to just shutting down your computer every time it 

					boots.

					<h5>Unwanted Junk</h5> <br /> On your computer you usually browse the web and most people also 

					download odds and ends occasionally so over time these files build up, when you browse 

					the web websites often store small amounts of information on your computer in the form of 

					cookies these files also mount up over time. If these files are not cleaned out, then they will 

					start to slow your computer down therefore when you try and use the web it will be very 

					slow because your computer will be clogged with temporary files.

					Identity Theft – Almost everybody has an online presence now these things include having 

					an account on Facebook twitter or other social media these can become hacked and a 

					criminal might take over your online life and lock you out this may allow the hacker to steal 

					your identity this may include them accessing your bank accounts.

					These are ways of protecting your computer

					<h5>Anti-Virus</h5> <br /> An antivirus is a piece of utility software which is used in order to prevent 

					viruses from gaining access to your computer and can also be used to remove viruses that 

					may have slipped through the protection or that was already on the computer before the 

					anti-virus program was installed. This software is essential for any computer that is internet 

					connected and even for computers that aren’t it is recommended this is because viruses 

					gain access to your computer through the internet and can also hide on usb drives and gain 

					access when plugged into computer.

					<h5>Spyware</h5> <br /> Spyware is a utility software that is used to prevent and remove a specific type 

					of virus that is designed to steal passwords or watch your browsing history it can do this by 

					scanning for the virus signature that is left behind by the virus.

					Firewalls – a firewall is a piece of software that is run on almost every computer system 

					and it is used to restrict access in and out over the network. The firewalls primary job is to 

					close off the ports that are open to the network and open and close them effectively as 

					legitimate software requests access to the network and requested data attempts to get in. a 

					good example is windows defender firewall.

					<h5>Adding good strong passwords</h5> <br /> adding strong passwords is good practice for helping 

					to secure your computer this is because when a hacker is trying to gain access to your 

					accounts or your computer they will usually go straight to guessing the password this is 

					because this is often the easiest method of gaining access to people’s accounts. A weak 

					password will be very easy to guess by a hacker and therefore will make keeping your 

					accounts secure very difficult. A google example of a password is a password which includes 

					a mixture of upper case and lower case charicters aswell as numbers, not having any 

					sequential numbers in the password also helps make it more difficult to guess.
