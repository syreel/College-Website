					<h3>web functionality</h3><br />

					<h5>Registrars</h5><br /> Registrars are companies that sell and maintain the domain names used for 

					connecting to websites without memorizing the unique ip address of the specific webpage 

					for example when you type in www.google.co.uk you are actually going to a dns (dynamic 

					name server) to find translate the domain name you just typed in into an ip address. The 

					dns is updated by the registrars when a company/an individual purchases a domain name.

					When you visit the dns it will give you back the ip address of the server that you are 

					attempting to visit so that your isp knows where to direct the request.

					<h5>WWW</h5><br /> The WWW is the world wide web this is the protocol used to determine that the 

					place you are trying to visit is a server on the world wide web this allows your router and 

					other systems to know that you are trying to access the www therefore it can redirect you 

					appropriately. We use the www because it is the more widely used protocol for webpages 

					<h5>Routers</h5><br /> The router is a piece of equipment that is used in multiple places and they are 

					used in order to redirect the data traffic around to the destination that the data packet has 

					attached to it. For example, when a packet of data is sent it is send with a destination ip 

					attached to it. When this packet hits a router the router can then use this data to determine 

					where the rata is to be routed to. Without routers the internet would not be possible 

					because all the data that is sent would have no path and would just go around the internet 

					with no destination therefore you would never be able to connect to a server or visit a 

					<h5>Browsers</h5><br /> The browser is a very complicated piece of software on the user’s computer, 

					this piece of software makes requests to web servers and upon receiving the html code for 

					the website it can convert this into a visual interface based on the html. When you visit any 

					website all that is sent back is html but your browser converts this into the nice looking page 

					that you actually end up seeing. We use browsers because if we didn’t when we tried to 

					view a webpage all we would see is html code and that would defeat the point of 

					programming webpages because we would just end up with plain text.

					<h5>Blogs</h5><br /> A blog is a webpage setup by an individual/organization in order to share their 

					experiences/other information with other people. These pages are usually very easy to 

					setup as there are a lot of companies that will happily create the blog page for you for a 

					price therefore the user just has to enter the blog materiel they would like to display and 

					the company does the hard part.

					<h3>Website software language</h3><br />

					<h5>Html</h5><br /> html (hypertext markup language) is the language used for writing the basic design 

					of the website it is used to layout the webpage and include any images. This is one of the 

					first piece for information to be delivered to the browser when a user requests a webpage 

					from a webserver.

					<h5>PHP</h5><br /> – PHP is the language used mainly by servers for running behind the scenes and 

					powering the webpage however it is sometimes used by the browser to do some kinds of 

					more complicated web design.

					<h5>JavaScript</h5><br /> JavaScript is used for client side customizing of webpages although it is usually 

					sent from the webserver alongside the rest of the webpage data. It can be used to further 

					customize the webpage and in order to create fancy menus and other professional looking 

					webpage elements.

					<h3>Website software</h3><br />

					<h5>Dreamweaver</h5><br /> Dreamweaver is a piece of computer software that is used to create basic 

					websites it is used because it requires very little to no programming in order to create a 

					basic webpage therefore It can be used by people who do not know how to actually 

					program a webpage from scratch. It can also be used if a professional want to create the 

					basic outline of the webpage before they edit the code generated at a lower level in order 

					to get the desired website more accurately.

					<h5>FrontPage</h5><br /> FrontPage is Microsofts version of Dreamweaver however it is now 

					discontinued it is used to create webpages and administer the webpage once active. 

					FrontPage has since been surpassed by Microsoft Expression Web and SharePoint Designer. 

					FrontPage hides the low level html code from the user therefore allowing novices to create 

					basic level websites with relative ease. FrontPage is a WYSIWYG (what you see is what you 

					get) editor this means that when you design your website in FrontPage it will look exactly 

					the same when you publish it to the web.

					Reference: Wikipedia – en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_FrontPage

					<h5>Web Servers</h5><br /> Web servers are servers that are specifically purposed to serving up 

					websites when requested by users. Web servers can be setup in multiple ways one way of 

					setting one up is putting a server edition version of Linux on the server this allows multiple 

					different packages to server up the webpages. A common package for hosting webpages is 

					apache although there are others such as ngin however there are more ways of hosting 

					including with php directly. Each method has a different purpose and it depends what type 

					of webpage you are trying to host and how many visitors are expected to bit the page.

					<h5>Email Servers</h5><br /> Email servers are used to store the emails for user’s accounts and also to 

					handle incoming and outgoing emails from and to different email servers. Typically, there 

					are multiple email accounts stored on each server depending on the amount of emails 

					stored and the storage of the server. However, there can also be multiple servers serving a 

					single email domain such as Gmail. When you use Gmail your email might be stored on one 

					of many servers run by google but there is no way of telling which as they are all in a cluster.

					<h5>Application servers</h5><br /> an application server is a software package that allows you to host 

					webpages. An example of this could be the php application server this allows a webserver to 

					host a php application such as a php powered webpage. The applications server handles 

					incoming requests for the page and requesting information from the web server.

					<h5>Database server<h5><br /> A database server is a server that is used in order to store information 

					such as client details and logins for a webpage. This server is sometimes run on the same 

					physical server as the webserver but for large applications it is usually separated out into a 

					databank in a different physical server if not in a different geological location. The database 

					runs in the back and it has a secure interface on the network which can then be queried in 

					order to get data out of the database and to the webserver that required the login 

					information for example the same principal applies to most data stored on the internet.

					<h5>Cloud computing</h5><br /> cloud computing is used because not everybody has a server sitting in 

					their cupboard that they can use to host a webpage or host their database on. There are 

					now a lot of companies that have servers sitting around doing nothing these companies use 

					these servers to rent out to people so that users can host their webpage on the company’s 

					servers this is a business and is used by many people for hosting their pages on the internet.

					<h5>Web 2.0 technologies</h5><br /> Web 2.0 is the web standard that was created in 1999 it is used 

					today in order to make sure websites comply with standards so that every browser can view 

					every webpage this is good because if we didn’t have web standard you would have to 

					download a package for every webpage you visited to make sure it displayed properly 

					however with web 2.0 standards as long as your browser complies and the web page 

					complies with the web 2.0 standards then in theory the web page will display correctly 

					however due to not every browser fully supporting new css standards this is not always the 

					<h3>User side performance factors</h3><br />

					<h5>PC Performance</h5><br />PC performance is very important with webpages this is because some 

					parts of webpages such as complicated JavaScript scripts are quite resource intensive and if 

					the user does not have a decent performance pc then they will not be able to view the page 

					because the page will go unresponsive after a short time due to a high JavaScript use.

					<h5>Processor</h5><br />The processor is very important for webpages as most of the rendering of the 

					html is done using the processor therefore if you have a slow processor then it will take a 

					long time to load webpages and any changes to the page will take a long time.

					<h5>Memory</h5><br />Memory or RAM (random access memory) is relatively important for webpages 

					because when a webpage is loaded onto the screen any recourses that are required for the 

					webpage such as the html JavaScript php and any images and css that may be used by the 

					webpage are stored in your computer’s memory so that the browser can quickly access 

					these resources. If you have slow or little memory, then pages might take longer to load and 

					the web might become unusable.

					<h5>Browser</h5><br />The performance of the browser is important for the performance of web pages 

					because when a webpage is loaded it is the browsers job to turn that into a proper user 

					viewable page and if the browser is slow and inefficient it doesn’t matter how good your 

					computer is if you have a slow browser then websites will be slow to load.

					<h5>ISP Connection Speed</h5><br />The internet speed you get from your isp is important because 

					when you request a webpage the information needed to display the webpage must be 

					downloaded to your computer and if you have a slow connection speed then you will not be 

					able to load the information fast enough therefore visiting webpages will take a long time 

					because information will take a long time to arrive at your computer.

					<h3>Server Side Performance Factors</h3><br />

					<h5>Bandwidth</h5><br />The server’s bandwidth is very important in the performance of the 

					webserver. This is because when a user attempts to access the webpage the information 

					that the use will need is transferred over the internet and if the website is quite complicated 

					then there will likely be quite a lot of information that needs to be transferred therefore if 

					there are multiple users attempting to access the website then the bandwidth of the server 

					can get full relatively quickly this will lower the performance of the webpage loading for 

					everybody trying to access it.

					<h5>Number of hits to a page</h5><br />The number of hits to a page is important because if the 

					website is getting a lot of traffic then it will start to put more strain on the web server 

					therefore the webpage will start to slow down for everybody that is trying to access the 

					website this could be fixed by hosting the website on multiple web servers in a cluster this 

					would mean half the traffic goes to one server and half to the other cutting down the load 

					File types used on a page – There are multiple different file formats for images, audio 

					and video for use on websites however each has an advantage and a disadvantage:

					JPG – A jpeg is a file format that is commonly used for images it is used very commonly on 

					the internet because it is a compressed file format therefore when a file is transferred as a 

					JPG file it is a smaller file size however because it is lossy compression it means that when 

					an image is converted into jpg format it loses some of its quality and depending on the 

					amount of compression required.

					GIF – A GIF is an image file format that is used to hold multiple images in one file these 

					images can then be played back as a set speed and is commonly used to make short 

					repeating animations. Gifs are used widely on the internet as it is a very common animation 

					BMP – A BMP file is an image file that does not compress images therefore they retain 

					almost all their detail when in this file format however these files are very large for high 

					quality images and therefore are slow to transfer due to this they are not very commonly 

					used on webpages unless a high quality image is required.

					MP3 – An MP3 file is an audio file format that is used to transfer audio files. Mp3 in 

					particular is commonly used because it allows for the compression of the audio when 

					converting it into mp3 files therefore you can save a significant amount of audio in a small 

					file size however you do lose some of the audio quality when you do this.

					AVI – AVI files are audio and video that are played back at the same time. This is used to 

					make a video that has sound synchronized with it this is a very common file format for 

					SWF – The SWF file format is commonly used for more complicated animations these files 

					can store more frames than a gif file can therefore they are used for more professional 

					animations. These can be used on the internet but the file sizes are quite large.

					Executions to be carried out before website performs – The amount of executions 

					to be performed before the website performs is important because if there is a lot of 

					executions to carry out when the user clicks on a menu item for example then the response 

					form the web server allowing them to go to the requested location will be delayed because 

					the website will have to perform a lot of actions and each of these takes time.

					Some of the security problems you could face – P3

					Hackers – Hackers are a big problem on the internet because there are lots of hackers on 

					the internet. Hackers will access your computer via security holes these can be found in 

					many places such as people not having a firewall installed on your computer this could 

					potentially mean that a hacker can gain access to your computer with little effort.

					Viruses – Viruses are malicious pieces of software often written by criminals these piece of 

					software often hide in other pieces of legitimate software in order to infiltrate a user’s 

					computer. These viruses can be programmed to do almost anything from sending your 

					passwords to the criminal in question to just shutting down your computer every time it 

					Unwanted Junk – On your computer you usually browse the web and most people also 

					download odds and ends occasionally so over time these files build up, when you browse 

					the web websites often store small amounts of information on your computer in the form of 

					cookies these files also mount up over time. If these files are not cleaned out, then they will 

					start to slow your computer down therefore when you try and use the web it will be very 

					slow because your computer will be clogged with temporary files.

					Identity Theft – Almost everybody has an online presence now these things include having 

					an account on Facebook twitter or other social media these can become hacked and a 

					criminal might take over your online life and lock you out this may allow the hacker to steal 

					your identity this may include them accessing your bank accounts.

					These are ways of protecting your computer

					Anti-Virus – An antivirus is a piece of utility software which is used in order to prevent 

					viruses from gaining access to your computer and can also be used to remove viruses that 

					may have slipped through the protection or that was already on the computer before the 

					anti-virus program was installed. This software is essential for any computer that is internet 

					connected and even for computers that aren’t it is recommended this is because viruses 

					gain access to your computer through the internet and can also hide on usb drives and gain 

					access when plugged into computer.

					Spyware – Spyware is a utility software that is used to prevent and remove a specific type 

					of virus that is designed to steal passwords or watch your browsing history it can do this by 

					scanning for the virus signature that is left behind by the virus.

					Firewalls – a firewall is a piece of software that is run on almost every computer system 

					and it is used to restrict access in and out over the network. The firewalls primary job is to 

					close off the ports that are open to the network and open and close them effectively as 

					legitimate software requests access to the network and requested data attempts to get in. a 

					good example is windows defender firewall.

					Adding good strong passwords – adding strong passwords is good practice for helping 

					to secure your computer this is because when a hacker is trying to gain access to your 

					accounts or your computer they will usually go straight to guessing the password this is 

					because this is often the easiest method of gaining access to people’s accounts. A weak 

					password will be very easy to guess by a hacker and therefore will make keeping your 

					accounts secure very difficult. A google example of a password is a password which includes 

					a mixture of upper case and lower case charicters aswell as numbers, not having any 

					sequential numbers in the password also helps make it more difficult to guess.

					<h3>ISP</h3><br />

					An ISP (internet service provider) is a company that provides a broadband connection to a 

					consumer. These companies gain connections to other isp’s and hosting companies this will 

					allow anybody using the isp to connect to everybody else. the isp then supplies a connection 

					to its consumers and they charge for this. The customer can then decide how much 

					bandwidth they would like to purchase. The isp then gives the user the connection to 

					everywhere else on the internet. When a user makes a request from their computer or 

					other device a request is sent for the information they would like this information then goes 

					to the isp which then decides where the information needs to be sent, when the isp receives 

					the response they then redirect it to the appropriate customer that requested the 

					information. These companies are required because without isp’s there would be no way 

					for consumers to connect with the internet as it is too difficult for each house to connect to 

					each other manually having the isp’s to manage these makes the internet possible.

					<h3>Web Hosting Service</h3><br />

					A web hosting service is where a company will host your website or other internet hosting 

					services for a fee. These companies use a massive cluster of servers and they will create 

					smaller vm’s on each of these machines which you can they pay for. Doing this allows the 

					user to pay for more power on the server for example and the server can be upgraded 

					without the hosting service actually changing and hardware they can just change some 

					settings on your virtual machine. These services are extremely useful because they allow 

					people to host their websites very cheaply and without the required hardware taking up 

					space and money at their house or otherwise. For a single person to host a website 

					themselves with their own hardware and network connections would be practically 

					impossible but because of web hosting services this is made possible. A good example is 

					square space this company allows you to host a website with them for a fee this also 

					includes the editor so that you can make the website easily.

					<h3>Domain name</h3><br />

					A domain name is a reference in a DNS (dynamic name server) that allows users to access 

					websites such as www.bbc.co.uk without using the actual ip of the server for example 

					(212.58.244.26) this means that when a user tries to connect to the bbc homepage they can 

					just type in bbc.co.uk instead of the ip which would be almost impossible to memories for 

					every website that you would want to visit. Domain names are very easy to get you can just 

					go to a domain registrar such as domain.com and type in the domain name you are looking 

					for and pay them a fee, often the registrar will point the domain to the server you want for 

					free or for a small fee.

					<h3>Domain Structure</h3><br />

					Domain names have a specific structure. In order from left to right the parts of the domain 

					Web Protocol: The web protocol typically looks like https:// at the beginning of the 

					domain, this section of the domain name is used to specify how you want to interface with 

					the destination server eg http/https/ftp/scp however modern browsers often add this 

					automatically and hide it so it cannot be seen unless required.

					Sub domain: The sub domain is a section of the domain name which is just before the 

					actual registered domain name and is separated from the domain name with a “.” This is 

					used to allow multiple destinations on a single domain name. a commonly used subdomain 

					Domain: the domain name is the actual domain that is registered and can be almost 

					anything, when you register a domain you can point its name server to any server you 

					would like. A good example is google which has google.com

					Top-level domain: the top level domain is the last part of the domain name and there are 

					a limited number of these domains. A good example is .com or .co.uk

					<h3>Application Layer</h3><br />

					Application Layer: The application layer is used to determine how information is handled 

					and converted as the information is requested and broadcast. This is the lowest layer for 

					information transport and is responsible for handling the incoming data and converting it 

					into the correct form for the program such as the browser to display that data correctly. The 

					application layer contains many different protocols and systems. For websites the http or 

					https protocols are used for transferring the html, js and css files. When other files need to 

					be transferred the ftp protocol is used to transfer the files.

					Transport layer: The transport layer is the second layer in the information transport 

					system. The transport layer is responsible for determinging the method with which the 

					information will be transferred there are different transport protocols such as udp and tcp 

					these are the 2 most common methods. When information is sent to a computer system or 

					webserver the information is sent through a port that is open on the destination computer 

					system it is the link between the transport layer and the application layer which determines 

					this port however this can be changed.

					Internet layer: the internet layer is responsible for determining where the packet of 

					information has come from and where its destination ip address is this information is 

					attached to the packet of information.

					Network Interface Layer: The network interface layer is the physical layer it includes all 

					the hardware required for data transfer such as your houses wireess network or Ethernet 

					network it also includes the physical connection between you and your isp and the location 

					where the information you are trying to access is stored.
