					User side performance factors – P2

PC Performance – PC performance is very important with webpages this is because some 

parts of webpages such as complicated JavaScript scripts are quite resource intensive and if 

the user does not have a decent performance pc then they will not be able to view the page 

because the page will go unresponsive after a short time due to a high JavaScript use.

Processor - The processor is very important for webpages as most of the rendering of the 

html is done using the processor therefore if you have a slow processor then it will take a 

long time to load webpages and any changes to the page will take a long time.

Memory – Memory or RAM (random access memory) is relatively important for webpages 

because when a webpage is loaded onto the screen any recourses that are required for the 

webpage such as the html JavaScript php and any images and css that may be used by the 

webpage are stored in your computer’s memory so that the browser can quickly access 

these resources. If you have slow or little memory, then pages might take longer to load and 

the web might become unusable.

Browser – The performance of the browser is important for the performance of web pages 

because when a webpage is loaded it is the browsers job to turn that into a proper user 

viewable page and if the browser is slow and inefficient it doesn’t matter how good your 

computer is if you have a slow browser then websites will be slow to load.

ISP Connection Speed – The internet speed you get from your isp is important because 

when you request a webpage the information needed to display the webpage must be 

downloaded to your computer and if you have a slow connection speed then you will not be 

able to load the information fast enough therefore visiting webpages will take a long time 

because information will take a long time to arrive at your computer.

Server Side Performance Factors

Bandwidth – The server’s bandwidth is very important in the performance of the 

webserver. This is because when a user attempts to access the webpage the information 

that the use will need is transferred over the internet and if the website is quite complicated 

then there will likely be quite a lot of information that needs to be transferred therefore if 

there are multiple users attempting to access the website then the bandwidth of the server 

can get full relatively quickly this will lower the performance of the webpage loading for 

everybody trying to access it.

Number of hits to a page – The number of hits to a page is important because if the 

website is getting a lot of traffic then it will start to put more strain on the web server 

therefore the webpage will start to slow down for everybody that is trying to access the 

website this could be fixed by hosting the website on multiple web servers in a cluster this 

would mean half the traffic goes to one server and half to the other cutting down the load 

File types used on a page – There are multiple different file formats for images, audio 

and video for use on websites however each has an advantage and a disadvantage:

JPG – A jpeg is a file format that is commonly used for images it is used very commonly on 

the internet because it is a compressed file format therefore when a file is transferred as a 

JPG file it is a smaller file size however because it is lossy compression it means that when 

an image is converted into jpg format it loses some of its quality and depending on the 

amount of compression required.

GIF – A GIF is an image file format that is used to hold multiple images in one file these 

images can then be played back as a set speed and is commonly used to make short 

repeating animations. Gifs are used widely on the internet as it is a very common animation 

BMP – A BMP file is an image file that does not compress images therefore they retain 

almost all their detail when in this file format however these files are very large for high 

quality images and therefore are slow to transfer due to this they are not very commonly 

used on webpages unless a high quality image is required.

MP3 – An MP3 file is an audio file format that is used to transfer audio files. Mp3 in 

particular is commonly used because it allows for the compression of the audio when 

converting it into mp3 files therefore you can save a significant amount of audio in a small 

file size however you do lose some of the audio quality when you do this.

AVI – AVI files are audio and video that are played back at the same time. This is used to 

make a video that has sound synchronized with it this is a very common file format for 

SWF – The SWF file format is commonly used for more complicated animations these files 

can store more frames than a gif file can therefore they are used for more professional 

animations. These can be used on the internet but the file sizes are quite large.

Executions to be carried out before website performs – The amount of executions 

to be performed before the website performs is important because if there is a lot of 

executions to carry out when the user clicks on a menu item for example then the response 

form the web server allowing them to go to the requested location will be delayed because 

the website will have to perform a lot of actions and each of these takes time.
